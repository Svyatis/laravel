                                    From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for thousands of years.
                                    Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars.
                                    They called these objects "planets," meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman
                                    deities—Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;
                                    Venus, the goddes of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of 
                                    agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and 
                                    meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky. Since the invention of 
                                    the telescope, three more planets have been discovered in our solar system:
                                    Uranus (1781), Neptune (1846), and, now downgraded to a dwarf planet, Pluto (1930).
                                    In addition, there are thousands of asteroids and comets. Most of 
                                    the asteroids orbit in a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, while the 
                                    home of comets lies far beyond the orbit of Pluto, in the Oort Cloud.',
